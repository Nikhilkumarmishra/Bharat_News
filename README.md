## 📚 Code Highlights

### MVVM Architecture
The app uses the MVVM architecture to separate concerns and improve testability. The ViewModel handles business logic, the View displays data, and the Model manages the data layer.

### Room Database
The Room database provides a simple way to store, query, and update local data. The `ArticleDao` interface defines the database operations, and the `NewsDatabase` class provides the database instance.

### Retrofit Networking
Retrofit simplifies HTTP requests and JSON parsing. The `NewsApi` interface defines the endpoints, and the `RetrofitInstance` class provides the Retrofit instance.

### Kotlin Coroutines
Coroutines handle background tasks efficiently, ensuring that the app remains responsive. They simplify async programming by allowing you to write sequential code.
