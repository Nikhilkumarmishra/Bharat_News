📚 Code Highlights
MVVM Architecture
The app uses the MVVM architecture to separate concerns and improve testability. The ViewModel handles business logic, the View displays data, and the Model manages the data layer.

Room Database
The Room database provides a simple way to store, query, and update local data. The ArticleDao interface defines the database operations, and the NewsDatabase class provides the database instance.

Retrofit Networking
Retrofit simplifies HTTP requests and JSON parsing. The NewsApi interface defines the endpoints, and the RetrofitInstance class provides the Retrofit instance.

Kotlin Coroutines
Coroutines handle background tasks efficiently, ensuring that the app remains responsive. They simplify async programming by allowing you to write sequential code.
